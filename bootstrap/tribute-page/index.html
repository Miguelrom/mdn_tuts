        <h2 class="font-weight-bold py-5 text-center">Here's some facts about this historic album:</h2>
        <ul class="list-group">
          <li class="list-group-item li-border">The black album is the fifth studio album from Metallica which was recorded over an eight-month period and release on August 12, 1991.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item li-border">This record was produced by Bob Rock, who had worked with notorious bands like Mötley Crüe, Bon Jovi, and Aerosmith.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item li-border">The recording process was long and painful, with constant clashes between the band members and the producer. This had a personal told on Metallica. After the recording was over three out of four members were divorced, namely: Lars, Jason and Kirk.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item li-border">The album is actually called Metallica. People from the press and fans started calling it the black album since it features a simplistic black art work.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item li-border">The album includes ten tracks, five of which were release as singles with acompaning video, namely:
          Enter Sandman, The Unforgiven, Nothing Else Matters, Whenever I May Roam, and Sad but true.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item li-border">The song "Nothing Else Matters" was not written to be a Metallica song. James Hetfield wrote it and recorded it on a cassette tape for himself, but thought it was too much of a love song for the band. Lars and Bob Rock heard it and thought it was just beautiful, so they convinced him to include it in the album.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item li-border">The black album is the most commercially successful album of Metallica, selling over 31 million copies world wide!!!</li>
          <li class="list-group-item li-border">Kirk Hammett lost his Porsche on a bet. Metallica's tour manager predicted that the album would sell at least 6 million copies. Kirk was a little skeptical, so he said he would give him his Porsche 911 Carrera if that ever happened. The prediction became a reality very quickly, so Kirk had to give out his Porsche.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item li-border">The world tour supporting the album lasted over two and a half years, begining in autum of 1991 and ending in the summer of 1993.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item li-border">A documentary called "A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica" was released showing the recording of the black album and the following tour.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item li-border">In 1992, the album won a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance. The band also performed "Enter Sandman" live for the event.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item li-border">As a way to celebrate their eponymous album 30-year anniversary, Metallica released a box set that includes a remastered version of the record, along with several memorabilia like magazine covers, hand-written lyrics, etc. </li>
          <li class="list-group-item li-border">Metallica is also releasing a tribute album called "The Metallica Black List", where 53 different artists cover their favorite songs of this iconic record.</li>
